def highest_student_gpa
    "select MAX(gpa) from students;" 
end

def lowest_student_gpa
    "select MIN(gpa) from students;" 
end

def average_student_gpa
    "select AVG(gpa) from students;" 
end

def total_tardies_for_all_students
    "select SUM(tardies) from students;" 
end

def average_gpa_for_9th_grade
    "select AVG(gpa) from students where grade = 9;"
